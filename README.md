# Bay Calendars

### Description
Upon loading the website, the user will be prompted to either create or login with an existing account. Once logged in, the user will be redirected to their profile page which will display a calendar with any events they have scheduled with details, along with upcoming events populated below the calendar where you can choose to either modify, delete, or invite another user to an event. The app will also allow users to go in and create a new event to add to their calendar by filling out a form on a seperate page.
