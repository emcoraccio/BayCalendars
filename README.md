# Bay Calendars

### Purpose
This site is designed to bring ease to the process of meeting up with friends or coworkers. Everyone has a busy schedule and it can be difficult to arrange times to get together; this takes care of the hassle of comparing availability by doing it for you and sending the invitation. Create and view your own events on your calendar, create and respond to other people's invitations, and easily manage your schedule.

### Use
Upon loading the website, the user will be prompted to either create or login with an existing account. Once logged in, the user will be redirected to their profile page which will display a calendar with any events they have scheduled with details, along with upcoming events populated below the calendar where you can choose to either modify, delete, or invite another user to an event. The app will also allow users to go in and create a new event to add to their calendar by filling out a form on a seperate page.
